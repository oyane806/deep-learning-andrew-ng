    "> <input type=\"radio\"> The first hidden layer’s neurons will perform different computations from each other even in the first iteration; their parameters will thus keep evolving in their own way.\n",

    "\n",
    "> <input type=\"radio\"> This will cause the inputs of the tanh to also be very large, thus causing gradients to also become large. You therefore have to set α to be very small to prevent divergence; this will slow down learning.\n",

    "    \n",
