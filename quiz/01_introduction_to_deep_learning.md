## Week 1 Quiz - Introduction to deep learning

##### 1. What does the analogy “AI is the new electricity” refer to?

> <input type="radio"> AI runs on computers and is thus powered by electricity, but it is letting computers do things not possible before.

> <input type="radio"> AI is powering personal devices in our homes and offices, similar to electricity.

> <input type="radio" checked> Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries.

> <input type="radio"> Through the “smart grid”, AI is delivering a new wave of electricity.
    
##### 2. Which of these are reasons for Deep Learning recently taking off? (Check the three options that apply.)

> <input type="checkbox"> Neural Networks are a brand new field.
    
> <input type="checkbox" checked> We have access to a lot more computational power.
    
> <input type="checkbox" checked> We have access to a lot more data.
    
> <input type="checkbox" checked> Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition.

##### 3. Recall this diagram of iterating over different ML ideas. Which of the statements below are true? (Check all that apply.)

> <input type="checkbox" checked> Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly.
    
> <input type="checkbox" checked> Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea.
    
> <input type="checkbox"> It is faster to train on a big dataset than a small dataset.
    
> <input type="checkbox" checked> Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware).

##### 4. When an experienced deep learning engineer works on a new problem, they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?

> <input type="radio"> True

> <input type="radio" checked> False

##### 5. Which one of these plots represents a ReLU activation function?

> <input type="radio"> Figure 1

<img src=img/01_02.png />

> <input type="radio"> Figure 2

<img src=img/01_03.png />

> <input type="radio" checked> Figure 3

<img src=img/01_04.png />

> <input type="radio"> Figure 4

<img src=img/01_05.png />

##### 6. Images for cat recognition is an example of “structured” data, because it is represented as a structured array in a computer. True/False?

> <input type="radio"> True

> <input type="radio" checked> False

##### 7. A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, economic growth is an example of “unstructured” data because it contains data coming from different sources. True/False?

> <input type="radio"> True

> <input type="radio" checked> False

##### 8. Why is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) used for machine translation, say translating English to French? (Check all that apply.)

> <input type="checkbox" checked> It can be trained as a supervised learning problem.

> <input type="checkbox"> It is strictly more powerful than a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

> <input type="checkbox" checked> It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g., a sequence of words).

> <input type="checkbox"> RNNs represent the recurrent process of Idea->Code->Experiment->Idea->....

##### 9.In this diagram which we hand-drew in lecture, what do the horizontal axis (x-axis) and vertical axis (y-axis) represent?

<img src = img/01_06.png />

> <input type="radio"> x-axis is the performance of the algorithm | y-axis (vertical axis) is the amount of data.

> <input type="radio" checked> x-axis is the amount of data | y-axis (vertical axis) is the performance of the algorithm.

> <input type="radio"> x-axis is the amount of data | y-axis is the size of the model you train.

> <input type="radio"> x-axis is the input to the algorithm | y-axis is outputs.

##### 10. Assuming the trends described in the previous question's figure are accurate (and hoping you got the axis labels right), which of the following are true? (Check all that apply.)

> <input type="radio"> Decreasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.

> <input type="radio"> Decreasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.

> <input type="radio" checked> Increasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.

> <input type="radio" checked> Increasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
