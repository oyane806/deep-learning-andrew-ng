    "##### 1. What does the analogy “AI is the new electricity” refer to?\n",
    "\n",
    "> <input type=\"radio\"> AI runs on computers and is thus powered by electricity, but it is letting computers do things not possible before.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <input type=\"radio\"> AI is powering personal devices in our homes and offices, similar to electricity.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <input type=\"radio\" checked> Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <input type=\"radio\"> Through the “smart grid”, AI is delivering a new wave of electricity.\n",
    "    \n",

    "> <input type=\"checkbox\" checked> We have access to a lot more data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "> <input type=\"checkbox\" checked> Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Recall this diagram of iterating over different ML ideas. Which of the statements below are true? (Check all that apply.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=img/01_01.png />\n",
    "\n",
    "> <input type=\"checkbox\" checked> Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly.\n",
    "    \n",
    "> <input type=\"checkbox\" checked> Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea.\n",
    "    \n",
    "> <input type=\"checkbox\"> It is faster to train on a big dataset than a small dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "> <input type=\"checkbox\" checked> Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. When an experienced deep learning engineer works on a new problem, they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?\n",

    "> <input type=\"radio\"> True\n",
    "\n",
    "> <input type=\"radio\" checked> False\n",
